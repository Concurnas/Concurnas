Concurnas compiled to JVM bytecode, and so Concurnas can be described as a JVM language. A great advantage of this interoperability is that we obtain full access to the standard JDK libraries included in Java. The examples listed here often make reference to these libraries. Being a JVM language means that we can integrate easily with code written in other JVM languages, such as Scala, Kotlin, Clojure.

\section{Calling Java code from Concurnas}


All of the below points are applicable to other JVM languages such as Scala and Kotlin. For the sake of brevity we shall use Java below.
