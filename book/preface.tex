\begin{verse}
Before the world had ever come to be,\\
This was set apart for you and I alone.\\
Although we go as shadows wandering,\\
Together we will make the journey home.

I've come so far\\
to see that every light will fade on the horizon\\
What do you seek?\\
Don't you know that there are eyes that see beyond you?

Countless days of solitude.\\
Frozen, my heart is frozen.\\
I feel the wound in my side\\
Open, I feel it open.

Who calls to me?\\
Will you fade into the wind like those before you?\\
In all your searching\\
What have you found that did not bind you or betray you?

Countless days of solitude.\\
Broken, my heart is Broken.\\
I feel the wound in my side\\
Open, I feel it open.

The woman came to me, clothed with the sun,\\
So wrapt in living flame, I begged to serve at her command.

This fire will not overcome you.\\
And fate is not bound in the past.\\
These flames will consume fear and weakness,\\
So don't forget where we began.

The same curse broke better men\\
I bow my head in shame\\
The same curse is set ablaze\\
as I walk into the flames.
