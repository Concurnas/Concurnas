\begin{verse}
\small
Who let the cat out of the bag?\\
Who told the world that I was older?\\
Who laughed at all I had?\\
Who said the race was over?

I am a small and gentle man\\
Who carries the world upon his shoulders\\
Kindly lend a helping hand...\\
Come over

And hold onto me,\\
Hold onto me,\\
And hold onto me,\\
Hold on

And my behavior is hard to understand\\
When I'm like a phone with no connection\\
But I'm still doin' all I can\\
To try and get me some redemption\\
And I'm knee deep in sinking sand\\
Crying out for your attention\\
Kindly lend a helping hand\\
For once defy convention

And hold onto me,\\
Hold onto me,\\
Hold onto me,\\
Hold on

And hold onto me,\\
Hold onto me,\\
Hold onto me,\\
Hold on

Our task is to transform ourselves,\\
Into awakened multidimensional beings\\
Thus fulfilling our dream.\\
The 4th and 5th dimensions to the third.\\
It is the inner meaning between Earth descending and Heaven ascending\\
This sacred magic has already been achieved by many of us.\\
The nameless others are awakening daily\\
As the cause steadfastly intensifies.\\
We are the claiming of divine birthright and heritage\\
Remembering that we are angels incarnate;\\
Vast starried beings of light.\\
We are no longer limited and bound by\\
The illusions of time, space, and matter\\
We are ready to join as unimensions? of the one\\
The new doorways cannot be opened or passed by any of us\\
Still operating as individual units of consciousness.\\
They are brought into manifestation from our unified presence;\\
Through our focused intent;\\
Through our total commitment to serving a higher purpose.\\
This is the bridge to an entirely different energy pattern.\\
It is the step beyond the mound dimensional universe.\\
It is a journey into the unknown\\
Which shall lead us ever closer to home.
